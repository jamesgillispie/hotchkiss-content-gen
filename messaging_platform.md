# **Messaging Platform for The Hotchkiss School**

## I. The Purpose of this Messaging Platform

The Hotchkiss School, a highly selective independent boarding school, is
distinguished by its rigorous academic program, its focus on guiding
teenagers to excel as individuals and students, and its closely
connected, pluralistic community. Much is asked and expected of
students, for Hotchkiss has always unapologetically required hard work.
But much support is also provided, especially today, as the School has
taken new strides in recent years to nurture students and give them the
confidence to take intellectual and creative risks. Hotchkiss faculty
are more than experts in their fields. They live, teach, coach, and
advise at Hotchkiss because they truly love educating and guiding
teenagers.

Across the last eight years of intentional evolution, Hotchkiss has
proven the value of an educational approach that nurtures exceptional
academic and co-curricular standards within a residential community that
is genuinely supportive and embraces the fun of being a teenager. The
School is now focused on communicating the Hotchkiss of today clearly
and with conviction to its audiences. This messaging framework must help
Hotchkiss articulate its transformation from a community once known for
impersonal and unyielding expectations to one committed to excellence
and caring that enable a diverse range of students to thrive in all
ways.

This messaging platform is deeply informed by the vision of School
leadership and the perceptions and experiences of current students and
their families, faculty, staff, parents, trustees, and alumni. It also
recognizes that while younger alumni know the Hotchkiss of today, older
alumni remember a different campus experience. In our efforts to
understand today's Hotchkiss and how constituencies past and present
view the School, we conducted interviews and focus groups with
representatives of every constituency noted above, visited campus twice,
reviewed extensive print and online materials, talked with educational
consultants who have known the School for decades, and closely examined
peer school websites.

Beyond striving through this discovery process to understand the School
and how it is perceived, our goal has been to develop language and
themes that capture Hotchkiss and its values while differentiating it
from its highly competitive peers. We also want to offer material that
the School can use or adapt across multiple forms of media and that
administrators, faculty, staff, board members, and other representatives
can use to convey the Hotchkiss culture and educational influence with
authenticity, clarity, and consistency.

# II. Audiences

- To support Hotchkiss's priority of communicating its growing strengths
  and offerings to future students, this platform aims to define and
  accentuate language and ideas that will resonate with **admissions
  prospects and their parents and families** and influence the
  **educational counselors** who work with them.

- In support of Hotchkiss's intention to be unified in its messaging,
  this platform also offers language and ideas for use by **School
  leaders, faculty, alumni,** and **advocates** in communicating to all
  audiences the shared story of who Hotchkiss is and is becoming.

# III. The Question of Cultural Transformation

As context for this material, we want to stress the consistency with
which every individual and group with whom we spoke observed that
Hotchkiss is in the midst of a profound cultural transformation. Based
on what we heard in these conversations, previously dominant attributes
of Hotchkiss have changed dramatically. The stark changes conveyed to us
are summarized below.

[Hotchkiss of the past:]

1. **Hyper-competitive and rigorous**, to the degree that several
    alumni separately shared that even decades since graduation, the
    mere thought of the flashing red traffic light near the School still
    fills them with anxiety and dread.

2. **Intolerant of failure of any kind**, including dramatic and
    unequivocal consequences for academic or behavioral errors.

3. **A pressure cooker of academic intensity and discipline**,
    resulting in graduates feeling that they had been mightily tested
    and ultimately were intellectually stronger for it.

4. **An athletics culture defined by a complete commitment to
    winning**, resulting in championships, considerable alumni pride,
    and a marked reputation as a school where the pressures of
    competition were severe and athletic ability mattered profoundly to
    achieving success within the community.

[Today's Hotchkiss:]

1. **A genuinely pluralistic learning community** focused on student
    well-being, holistic personal development, and care for each
    individual. This transformative shift offers a strong differentiator
    for Hotchkiss compared to peers, yet it still does not widely inform
    its reputation among prospective families, educational counselors,
    and some alumni.

2. **Still-rigorous expectations for academic performance**, but ones
    backed by close personal encouragement and support.

3. **An empathetic and educational approach** to failure and error,
    notably when students violate behavioral expectations.

4. **A wide array of athletics opportunities** where the role athletics
    play in overall adolescent development is now prioritized alongside
    winning performance.

As these changes suggest, those who know Hotchkiss best believe it is
increasingly becoming a community that sees and supports students as
individuals while still challenging them with high academic and
co-curricular expectations. Self-discipline, drive, and curiosity remain
hallmarks of students who get the most out of the Hotchkiss experience,
but an environment of care and encouragement has largely replaced
yesterday's pressure cooker.

These changes have been intentional, driven by the premise that students
thrive when Hotchkiss matches its rigorous expectations with the
institutional and cultural scaffolding for individual growth and
persistence. Current students, as well as School leaders and faculty,
affirmed the value of these changes to us emphatically. In every group
we spoke with, several people told us that the School's emerging culture
allows students to challenge themselves, take risks, and manage the
stress of the demanding Hotchkiss educational experience.

We have emphasized this transformation partly because of how appreciated
it seems to have become. But we do so because we also believe, based on
our work with elite institutions at every educational level, that
Hotchkiss is in a position to assert new national leadership. It shows
how secondary schools can rise to the expected level of support families
typically seek for their children while preparing young graduates to
meet and take leadership roles in a changed world.

This context explains why we recommend in this messaging platform that
Hotchkiss admission communications:

- Speak the language of students and their families;

- Center the School's commitment to student holistic well-being; and

- Emphasize the School's readiness to serve students during their
  teenage years, a singular time of growth and self-discovery.

Based on the School's well-established reputation, we also think that
Hotchiss must convey its focus on student wellbeing and strong community
with confidence, emphasis, and consistency. Otherwise, the strong and
lingering impressions of the School's stern and unforgiving past may
endure.

To summarize our recommendation: **Admissions messaging should stress
Hotchkiss's emphasis on its caring, supportive, and joyful culture,
which enables students to thrive and succeed in this highly rigorous and
rewarding academic environment.**

# IV. Core Differentiators

Hotchkiss's distinct value proposition for prospective students is
rooted in a transformative educational experience backed by a caring and
diverse community. To reflect this, we recommend building messaging
around these three pillars:

## Academic excellence

> *Why should prospective students care? Because... What you learn and
> how you learn to think at Hotchkiss will position you to pursue
> anything in life you want to accomplish.*
>
> We encourage and empower students to pursue their curiosity through
> deep engagement with a wide-ranging curriculum that features both
> required foundational elements and a broad choice of electives. Our
> approach fosters self-discipline and creativity, asks for continual
> written and oral reflection, and inspires exploration across every
> aspect of campus life. This experience helps students develop the
> capacity to think about complex, multidisciplinary problems clearly
> and with nuanced understanding while gaining confidence in their
> ability to solve them. It is a foundation on which Hotchkiss graduates
> can build throughout a lifetime. â€‹\
> \
> Proof points that illustrate this pillar include:

a. Across more than 200 courses in seven departments, with an average
    class size of 12, students explore a broad range of subjects.

b. Our hands-on, skills-based curriculum includes fascinating electives
    across numerous disciplines, some of which include conducting
    original research in partnership with leading universities.

c. Through all four years, a comprehensive focus on writing supports
    students in learning to discern and dissect an argument, to ground
    their ideas in knowledge, and to express them clearly, all while
    gaining meaningful confidence in their intellectual abilities.

d. Students learn among peers who challenge and inspire them. By
    welcoming the most capable students to Hotchkiss, regardless of
    their financial circumstances, Hotchkiss continually elevates
    learning for everyone.

e. Hotchkiss recognizes and respects different points of view. Since
    2019, we have worked with the University of Chicago on incorporating
    the values of open discourse into the community in a safe and
    scaffolded way. Student-led discussion forums engage with
    challenging topics both on- and off-campus, welcoming differing
    points of view while ensuring that all students feel safe, seen, and
    supported.

f. The learning experience at Hotchkiss is one of mutual engagement.
    Teachers, coaches, and advisors listen while they teach and reflect
    at the same time they instruct. This supports students in developing
    a strong sense of self-confidence in their own minds and
    capabilities.

g. Students can strive for numerous leadership positions throughout
    their time here, developing skills not only of leadership but also
    of resilience in the face of challenges. When students bring these
    skills to bear in the classroom, there is no limit to what they can
    achieve.

h. Hotchkiss's beautiful location in the Berkshire-Taconic region of
    northwestern Connecticut creates an idyllic atmosphere featuring
    hundreds of acres of woods and fields with access to streams, a lake
    ecosystem, and night skies virtually free from light pollution---all
    of which are spaces in which to learn.

i. [The School's single main building supports community connections,
    creating a cultural center for everyone on campus, allowing students
    to come together and have fun, with short walking distances to
    classes and dorms that simplify campus life.]

j. [With an international footprint, Hotchkiss is a] [[[Round
    Square]](https://www.roundsquare.org/) school, the only
    one in the Eight Schools Association. Students can learn abroad
    through numerous travel programs and receive generous financial
    support to do so.]

k. [The academic experience is inextricably intertwined with the
    individual attention and support that every student
    experiences.]

## Individual attention and support

> *Why should prospective students care? Because... You don't have to do
> it on your own. Your teachers, coaches, advisors, dorm faculty, and
> counselors will know you as a person and will show you that you
> matter. We don't just "support students." We support
> [you].*
>
> We support each student's aspirations and potential in numerous ways,
> starting with a campus of exceptional educators who believe in helping
> teenagers grow as individuals and as valued contributors to the
> community they create.
>
> Proof points that illustrate this pillar include:

a. With approximately 600 students, Hotchkiss is medium-sized relative
    to peers--large enough for significant diversity of every kind while
    small enough to ensure that campus adults support every student.

b. Our student-instructor ratio is 4:1. Every student is known and
    supported by many adults on campus.

c. Seventy percent of faculty members live on campus, creating close
    bonds between students and faculty and high faculty awareness of the
    needs and well-being of the students entrusted to their care.

d. Faculty members live on every floor of every dorm, ensuring that
    residential spaces are supportive.

e. Our average faculty member has more than 23 years of teaching
    experience, ranking us third among our peers in teacher tenure.

f. Most of our faculty coach at least one sport, further deepening
    their understanding of and connection to students.

g. Students engage closely with a single faculty advisor throughout
    their time at Hotchkiss, working together to plan a balanced course
    of study that aligns with each student's college aspirations and
    beyond.

h. Every upper mid is assigned an experienced college advisor who
    supports and engages the student and their family throughout the
    college process.

i. The Teaching and Learning Center works one-on-one with students to
    help them reach academic goals, providing tutoring and learning
    resources and assisting kids who may need to make up a significant
    amount of classwork.

j. Experienced library staff are available to identify resources and
    engage with students on various schoolwork, sophisticated research,
    and projects.

k. Supportive one-on-one mental health counseling is available on
    campus to all students.

l. The Head of School knows every Hotchkiss student, eats meals in the
    dining hall, meets frequently with individual students and groups,
    and regularly stands outside his office to greet kids by name as
    they walk between classes.

## A caring community like no other

> *Why should prospective students care? Because... You will not be
> alone here. No matter your interests, passions, talents, communication
> style, insecurities, and sense of humor, you will be surrounded by
> people who "get" you.*
>
> This is a caring community of intellectually curious and diverse young
> people from across the U.S. and the globe. At Hotchkiss, students
> deepen their awareness of the world and others as they learn, live,
> create, compete, stumble, and succeed together, growing in the
> confidence that they can thrive and make a difference in every
> setting.

Proof points that illustrate this pillar include:

> Overall:

a. [Hotchkiss is a [school], not a mini-university. The
    community, including the ways adult support is structured and that
    fun and joy are incorporated is designed for teenagers.]

b. One of our fundamental learning values is providing a residential
    community where every student feels safe, seen, and supported. This
    is a value we live by.

c. The Hotchkiss experience is [everyone\'s] experience.
    That's why financial aid packages are not limited to tuition.
    Qualifying families can receive non-tuition aid that is discrete and
    invisible to peers. This can cover everything from student and
    family air travel to international trips, athletic equipment, books,
    money for the snack bar, and much more.

d. [The School's single main building supports community connections as
    all students and teachers interact throughout the day.]

> Community Life:

e. Our commitment to pluralism and diversity spans geography, language,
    socioeconomic background, gender, identity, religious affiliation,
    political perspective, neurodiversity, and much more.

f. Students represent 37 U.S. states and 29 countries.

g. In 2024, 41 percent of entering domestic students self-identify as
    people of color (vs. about 30 percent in 2019), thanks to bold
    programming designed to recruit students of color, strengthen
    relationships with community-based organizations, and open new
    communication channels with talented students and their families.

h. Recognizing the criticality of students seeing themselves in the
    adults around them, we continue to prioritize and invest in
    programming that successfully attracts and retains a diverse
    faculty.

i. Hotchkiss students have created approximately 80 advocacy, culture,
    and affinity groups that allow students to share and learn from one
    another's experiences, cultures, and beliefs.

j. [Hotchkiss's commitment to service goes back to the beginning. St.
    Luke's Society, the primary service organization, was founded in
    1892 and continues to thrive.]

k. [Ninety percent of students participate in a sport. Other
    co-curricular options include theater productions, work on Fairfield
    Farm, and care of the School's woods and trails, among many
    others.]

l. [School spirit is everywhere! From cheering crowds of kids at
    athletic events to pep rallies, class carnivals, "Troppy Tuesdays,"
    "Fun Fridays," Head of School holidays, spirit week, senior week,
    etc.]

> Dorm Life:

m. Approximately ninety-six percent of students board. This is one of
    the lowest percentages of day students among peer schools, creating
    a genuinely close-knit, immersive community.

n. Dormitories house preps and lower mids (9th and 10th graders)
    [or] upper mids and seniors (11th and 12th graders),
    ensuring that students live among age-appropriate peers. The
    exception to this is Watson Dormitory, a welcoming all-gender
    housing option available to students of any age.

o. [Faculty members are assigned to every floor of each dorm. Their
    partners, children, and pets often live with them, creating a family
    atmosphere.]

p. [Trained upperclass students serve as proctors in their dorms,
    watching out for their peers and helping to create a safe,
    respectful community.]

> Wellbeing:

q. Annual well-being programming addresses topics such as consent and
    healthy relationships; sleep; social media use; positive vs.
    negative self-talk; being a bystander vs. being an upstander; and
    many other topics.

r. Each year, we field an anonymous survey to all students that
    assesses student perspectives on classroom norms, fairness, bias,
    social dynamics, residential life, social media use, drug and
    alcohol use, sense of well-being, and more. The survey results,
    which are only reviewed in aggregate, assist the School in
    developing data-driven responses to student needs.

s. We continue to evaluate and adjust School policies to align with
    educational outcomes. For example, aligning the School's drug and
    alcohol policy with learning rather than punishment, limiting the
    use of cell phones in shared spaces, and introducing an anti-bias
    reporting form that can be used by any student at any time to report
    any incident of concern.

t. Hotchkiss faculty and staff must participate in extensive yearly
    training that supports students' safety and care.

> The Natural World

u. Stunning campus... woods, fields, lakefront ecosystems...

v. Hotchkiss remains committed to reducing our carbon footprint, which
    has come down by 50% in the last 10 years without the use of carbon
    offsets.

# V. Core Narrative and Content Guidance

The Core Narrative guides public-facing messaging, including the
Hotchkiss website, videos, printed materials, and more. It is shaped
around this essential message:

# Hotchkiss is Ready for You

## For Admissions

> This paragraph sums up the type of statements in admissions outreach
> that can back this message:
>
> **Because you want to challenge yourself, build your knowledge and
> confidence, and prepare for a life of success and discovery, we offer
> you an intensive, caring, and fun place to go to school. You will be
> seen and supported by faculty dedicated to your growth and by a
> diverse community of fellow students from across the country and
> around the world who are just as motivated and attentive to others as
> you are. For every student who wants to become their best self and
> grow creatively, intellectually, and personally, we are ready for
> you.**
>
> In admissions outreach, this narrative will be most effectively
> delivered with content that speaks directly to the student from
> various angles. For example:

- **If you love to learn**, *Hotchkiss is ready for you.*

- **If you love a challenge**, *Hotchkiss is ready for you.*

- **If you want a community that will support you**, *Hotchkiss is ready
  for you.*

- **If you're ready to explore**, *Hotchkiss is ready for you.*

- **If you love to laugh,** *Hotchkiss is ready for you.*

- **If you want to test new interests and talents**, *Hotchkiss is ready
  for you.*

- **If you have a bold vision for your future,** *Hotchkiss is ready for
  you.*

- **If you want to meet new friends who are as excited about learning as
  you are,** *Hotchkiss is ready for you.*

> In sharing student stories, you can flip the frame and let students
> share the core narrative from the first-person perspective. For
> example:

- **I was ready for a conservatory experience**. *Hotchkiss was ready
  for me.*

- **I was ready to immerse myself in global culture by studying
  abroad**. *Hotchkiss was ready for me.*

- **I wanted to excel in soccer *and* physics**. *Hotchkiss was ready
  for me.*

- **I wanted to learn from people with experiences different from my
  own**. *Hotchkiss was ready for me.*

- **I was nervous about boarding school.** *Hotchkiss was ready for me.*

- **I wasn't sure I could succeed.** *Hotchkiss was ready for me.*

> Because student admissions audiences typically judge messages quickly
> and with deep skepticism of institutions and institutional marketing,
> Hotchkiss's outreach to students must be plainspoken, authentic, and
> relatable to middle-schoolers' experiences. Whenever possible,
> Hotchkiss should include or feature its students in its outreach. The
> following approaches can help it do so:

- Use direct video content of current students speaking about their
  teachers, their fellow students, and their experiences.

- Emphasize the School's impact on students rather than foregrounding
  the School talking about itself.

- Incorporate short narratives and quotations about and from current
  students that emphasize the ideas behind the core differentiators.

- Feature short profiles of and quotes from alumni, particularly younger
  alumni, referencing their exciting work in various fields and how
  their Hotchkiss experience prepared them for it.

- Include parent testimonials about their child's experience, why they
  chose Hotchkiss instead of other fine institutions in its peer set,
  and the difference Hotchkiss has made.

## For Alumni

> In highlighting alumni stories as part of admissions outreach, you
> can, for example, illustrate how Hotchkiss prepared graduates for
> their careers:
>
> For example:

- **I discovered how much I loved performing---and how much it could
  teach me.** *Hotchkiss was ready for me.\
  *--Allison Janney '77, award-winning actress

- **Julie Cotler Pottinger '87**, author of Bridgerton series

- **Emylie Bydewell '04**, coach of Olympic rugby team that won a
  first-ever medal for the US (bronze, 2024)

- **GINA KINGSBURY '00,** *2006 Olympic Winter Games Gold Medalist, 2010
  Olympic Winter Games Gold Medalist*

- **[Kip Kroeger \'00]**, one of the creators of Ted Lasso

- **Tom Werner**, founder of Carsey-Werner television productions &
  owner of Boston Red Socks

- *More to be added...*

# VI. Building Core Narrative Content

To convey the core narrative across media of all kinds, content creators
should pursue questions that draw out related ideas. Toward that end, we
recommend these types of questions:

## Guiding Questions for Interviews with Current Students

- What have you discovered at Hotchkiss that you didn't expect would be
  waiting here for you?

- What has Hotchkiss shown you about yourself--your abilities, a
  particular skill, a particular interest, or something else--that you
  hadn't anticipated learning here?

- What challenge at Hotchkiss taught you the most?

- What example can you share of someone who supported you during a
  critical moment of your Hotchkiss experience?

- What has Hotchkiss taught you about how you want to support the people
  around you? What's an example?

- Describe a memorable classroom experience. Was this what you expected
  from your teacher? If not, what was different?

- What has surprised you the most about Hotchkiss?

- If you were speaking to your younger self and encouraging that person
  to consider attending Hotchkiss, what would you say?

- As you look toward the years ahead, what have you learned so far from
  Hotchkiss that is going to stick with you the most? Why?

## Guiding Questions for Interviews with Faculty

- What do you want your students to take from the classes you teach?

- What do you do when you see a student struggling? Or when you see a
  student who hasn't discovered how good they could be at something?

- What do you enjoy most about working with teenagers?

- What does it mean to be academically rigorous? How does that play out
  in your own teaching?

- What does it mean that Hotchkiss is a supportive community?

- What example can you share of a time you saw someone support a student
  during a critical moment of their Hotchkiss experience (whether it was
  you providing that support, or something you saw a colleague or
  another student do)?

- Are there ways you have seen Hotchkiss teach students---or you---about
  how you want to support the people around you as they learn? What's an
  example?

- How does living among your students affect how you teach and mentor?

- How does the Hotchkiss community differ from your experiences
  elsewhere?

## Guiding Questions for Interviews with Parents

- What qualities were most important to you when choosing a school for
  your child, and what made you think Hotchkiss would offer those
  qualities?

- How has Hotchkiss delivered on your expectations? Is there a story
  that sums it up?

- How has your child grown during their time at Hotchkiss? What specific
  story might you share of how Hotchkiss or someone at the School helped
  that growth along?

- If your child has ever struggled at Hotchkiss, or just hadn't
  appreciated yet how good they could be at something, were there ways
  you saw Hotchkiss help them?

- How have you seen Hotchkiss affect your child's confidence, interest
  in learning, ambitions in certain fields, or other ways that you
  consider most meaningful?

- If you were to encourage other parents to consider sending their child
  to Hotchkiss, what would you say?

- What has surprised you the most about your child's Hotchkiss
  experience?

- How have [you] felt welcomed and involved at Hotchkiss?

# VII. Keywords and Tone

We advise that in conveying the new narrative, Hotchkiss messaging:

- Prioritize connecting what Hotchkiss offers to students rather than
  highlighting aspects of the School for their own sake. In doing so,
  lead with the benefits to students of the Hotchkiss experience, backed
  up by the relevant Hotchkiss features, not the other way around.
  (e.g., "At Hotchkiss, you/students will....Because Hotchkiss...." Not:
  "Hotchkiss characteristics include....")

- Prioritize using messengers most like the audience whenever possible.

- Remain cognizant of the pre-established and alternative reputation of
  Hotchkiss that today's story must replace or overcome.

- Be upbeat and personal in tone and language, and avoid unnecessary
  formality.

- Put fun and joy in the foreground.

- Embody the intelligence and discernment of the community and
  prospective students.

Below we list keywords that can support this approach. As these terms
are meant as discrete vocabulary ideas to encourage similar verbiage, we
have not prioritized parallel parts of speech.

## **School Environment**

- Community
- Pluralistic
- Residential
- Home
- Nature
- Global
- Friendly
- Safe

## **Values and Culture**

- Respect
- Intellectual
- Excellence
- Diverse
- Empathetic
- Inspiring
- Joyful
- Supportive

## **Student Development**

- Create
- Discover
- Prepare
- Energy
- Drive
- Self-discipline
- Curiosity

To further illustrate this recommended tone and approach, we contrast
next the type of community qualities that the School's outreach should
embody versus those it should never evoke. These terms are inherently
pointed to contrast starkly who Hotchkiss is becoming versus what it
refuses to be anymore.

## **Hotchkiss is always:**

- Curious
- Supportive
- Collegial
- Rigorous
- Competitive
- Hustling
- Active
- Welcoming
- Global
- Connecting
- Inspiring
- Confident

## **Hotchkiss is never:**

- Indifferent
- Adversarial
- Cutthroat
- Rote
- Apathetic
- Complacent
- Passive
- Exclusionary
- Provincial
- Isolated
- Discouraging
- Arrogant

# VIII. Visual Style Guide

Hotchkiss' commitment to recruiting, admitting, nurturing, and educating
a diverse community of highly talented and motivated teenagers reflects
a clarity of mission and values. It delivers this experience in a
stunning and secluded natural environment. The energy, conviction, and
empathy that have become hallmarks of the Hotchkiss experience should be
expressed not only in its language but also in its visual presentation
of its story. We therefore recommend that the visual and graphic
representation of Hotchkiss convey these attributes:

- **Energetic and Passionate:** Lively colors and bold framings,
  including fun illustrations and vibrant animated touches whenever
  possible.

- **Communal**: Images of one-to-one and small-group interactions, from
  classrooms to dining, residence halls to other casual environments.

- **Rigorous, Hustling, and Supportive:** Images centering hard work,
  risk-taking, and challenge in diverse classroom experiences (e.g.,
  public speaking, writing sessions, laboratories, art studios, field
  work), with surrounding faculty and/or students providing supportive
  looks and actions.

- **Beautiful and Inspiring:** Images of students and faculty engaging
  with one another with fervor and teamwork in the School's world-class
  study and performance spaces, outdoor settings, athletics, and clubs,
  particularly those showing a moment of revelation.

- **Global**: Images that speak the Hotchkiss language of the world
  through the people, colors, and settings shown.
